Are you ready to take your knowledge and career to the next level?</p><p>30 hours of on-demand videos, 50 coding exercises, 70 quizzes, and 12 assignments. All this is to help you start coding in JavaScript like a pro.</p><p>I'm a Mozilla developer with over 10 years of experience. I will help you on this journey every step of the way, no matter if you are a complete beginner who has never coded before or a developer who wants to advance to the next level. We will start from the basics, but we will not stop there.</p><p>I will not only teach you how to code but also how to code well. Clean code and good design will be our priorities, and design patterns will be shown in practice, not as abstract concepts that seem impossible to be used in real-life challenges. Refactoring will be something we practice all the time.</p>",
